# HOW TO ACCESS THE DATABASE?

I've shared the exported file for the database which you can import in PhpMySql, I've used Xampp So one can go to the admin page of xampp, create a new database and select and import the sql file that I've shared for database.

# HOW TO GET ACCESS TO THE CODE?

You can clone the repository from the repository link that I've mentioned in the mail in your Xampp's htdocs folder(important), I had 'event-app-demo' folder in my htdocs folder.

# HOW TO RUN THE CODE?

You can use npm start on the terminal after opening event-app-demo in your VSCode, which will run the code. I've covered all the points as per the assignment. Thanks.
